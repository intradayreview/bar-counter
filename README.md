# Bar Counter

This script is an indicator for financial charts that displays a count of the number of session bars within a specified time range and displays analysis of the candlesticks within the session. 

The start and end times for the session can be specified by the user, as well as the session range in the format "HHMM-HHMM". The user can also choose to show or hide a colored background behind the session, a count of the session bars, and candlestick analysis. 

The candlestick analysis labels each candlestick as either Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral based on the position of the close relative to the top and bottom thirds of the price range, and also indicates whether the close is outside or inside the range of the previous candlestick. 

The user can choose to show the analysis for only the last two candlesticks.
